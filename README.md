# React Portfolio

## Description
This a portfolio I created using React. It includes a bio, projects page and a contact page.  

## Page
https://juliaguas17.github.io/React-Portfolio/

## Screenshots
As you can see, the navigation highlights on hover but does not change based on the part of the page you are on in the current development stage.

However, I have implemented a mobile responsive navigation.

## Future Development
I'm still in the process of adding my resume file, contact form, and footer to this page.  I'm also looking to edit the font styling to be a bit more legible in the project section. Stay tuned.
